POSSIBLE_CONFIGS = (GAN+encoder+decoder}) OR (encoder+decoder-GAN)
* Train discriminator if you need, detach if you don't need.
* Train with content loss, pixel wise loss
* Intended for rapid research experiments

## Requirements
* Tensorflow 2.1 <
* opencv

## Train custom
* Select the dataformat in config file, the available formats are "AUTO" and "PAIRED".
   AUTO: Just provide high resolution images path so it automatically downscales and trains, if needed add custom degradations
   PAIRED: provide with high-resolution and low-resolution images which to be in paired format to train.
   set the format in config file and also adjust given parameters like epochs, batchsize as per your task.

``` 
data_template = AUTO
``` 
#### Define your model architectures in g_engine and d_engine model
``` 
#EXAMPLE CODE OF CALLING YOUR CUSTOM MODELS

from g_engine.rdnsr import *
from d_engine.discrim import *
generator     = RRDNSR(upsample=2,rdb_depth=8) #CUTSOM BUILT GENERATOR
discriminator = discriminator(h_,w_) #CUSTOM BUILT DISCRIMINATOR
``` 

#### Task Examples
##### * Image super-resolution

##### * Image-colorization

> Todo
- [x] add distributed data and training pipeline
- [ ] add more research papers in the pipeline
